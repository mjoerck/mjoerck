## Hi, I am Magnus

I spend lots of time learning new languages and working with fun algorithms. I am passionate about mathematics, especially in investment and disciplines such as optimization, analysis, statistics and the use of data in the home. 

I am currently learning F#. I also play with Python, R, C++ and more. 

I love connecting with other passionate people, so feel free to connect with me here on Github!
